While these models show promise in structured environments with clear rewards, they struggle with open-ended tasks that lack frequent feedback, such as creative writing or philosophical reasoning. The author argues that despite the advancements in RL, these models do not generalize well beyond their training domains, leading to subpar performance in tasks requiring nuanced understanding. The piece highlights the challenges of scaling model size and the potential stagnation in AI development if the focus remains solely on improving reasoning without addressing the need for larger, more capable models. Key insights include the importance of transfer learning, the limitations of RL in sparse reward environments, and the need for models that can handle complex, unstructured tasks effectively.\n",
